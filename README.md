This is a MERN Stack Ecommerce website which is basically a Nike footware products ssite.I have used React,Tailwind and Vite in frontend while ia have used axios,react-redux and MongoDB in backend.
The application allows user authentication by the Login and SignUp page which has proper validations so the the genuine user can only run the application.The main application is divided into various sections
like navigationbar,hero,products,filters,about ,contact and footer. 
The aplication provides seamless user experience due to its beatifully designed UI.The animation and effects used in this application are really very nice. 
For the user data Storage I have used mongoDB compass or you can use MongoDB Atlas Also.
